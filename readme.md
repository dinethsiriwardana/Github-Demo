# GitHub 101 Documentation

A comprehensive documentation website about GitHub basics, created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This documentation-style site provides beginners with a clear, step-by-step guide to using GitHub.

- Documentation-style layout with sidebar navigation
- Responsive design that works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Interactive table of contents with automatic highlighting of the current section
